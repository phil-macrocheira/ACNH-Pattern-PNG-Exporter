# ACNH Pattern PNG Exporter
A simple windows program that displays and exports patterns as PNG from .nhd pattern files exported from save files for Animal Crossing New Horizons (ACNH) for Nintendo Switch using [NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE). To use, just select the folder containing the .nhd files and all patterns will be exported as PNG files to a folder called 'output'.

Currently does not work properly for 64x64 pro designs (.nhdp files), but I plan to fix it.
